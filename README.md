# leaflet-challenge

Purpose: 

The purpose of this repo was to read earthquake Json data from the USGS website and then overay the data onto a static map. The static map can be zoom in and out and would have colorful circles representing the earthquakes and when a user clicks on one of the circes then a small pop up with information related to the earthquake would appear. 

The code mainly uses Javascript and HTML.
